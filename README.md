# fractalGenerator
A fractal generator I made back when I was doing A-levels
To run the program, download the two jar files, keep them in the same directory and double click on "fractalGenerator.jar". 
To use the tutorial, choose Mandelbrot Z^2 as your fractal.
Not sure how copyright works but I used JLatexMath to render LaTeX in my program.
