# fractalGenerator
A fractal generator I made as my first 'proper' project.
To run the program, download the two jar files, keep them in the same directory and double click on "fractalGenerator.jar". 
To use the tutorial, choose Mandelbrot Z^2 as your fractal.
Not sure how copyright works but I used JLatexMath to render LaTeX in my program.
